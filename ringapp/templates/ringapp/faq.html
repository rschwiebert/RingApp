                Yes: the reason is that a great deal of the logic connecting properties here
                uses the assumption that the ring has identity. However, there are many interesting examples
                out there that are not quite rings, and it would be a pity to overlook them.  For this reason,
                we will keep <a href="/misfits">a page of misfit examples.</a>

                Yes, there are! It has a few weaknesses at present. One is that it is only refreshed every once in a
                while, so it may take a few hours to be updated. The search should yield current results, though.
                Another thing is that the script that generates the entries from logic stored in the database makes
                some bad suggestions in edge cases. There are not many of these problematic entries, and feel free to
                ask a question via the suggestion form about specifics.

                Given two rings $R, S$ and an $R,S$ bimodule $M$, the set $\begin{bmatrix}R&M\\0&S\end{bmatrix}$ with
                matrix addition and multiplication becomes a ring. Alternatively, it could be
                $\begin{bmatrix}S&0\\M&R\end{bmatrix}$. We call this construction the <b>triangular ring</b> formed by
                $R,M$ and $S$.
